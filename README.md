## openai
The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images. We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.

## langchain
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:
Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
Be agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment
The LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.
